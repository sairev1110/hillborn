                                Simply put, data cleansing is the process of eliminating, upgrading, and editing information within a database in order to maintain top-notch data quality. This data analysis processing gives access to segmented and accurate data, which helps organizations to streamline their CRM productivity while focusing on multi-channel marketing initiatives and business operations.

                            <p className="">
                                At Hillborn Solutions, our data cleaning experts work towards delivering an error-free customer list that improves and centralize your business operations management efforts. Through a full suite of data cleaning services, our team ensures to generate accurate contact information without compromising on data quality while supporting you with successful email delivery. Hereâ€™s, how our data cleansing process works:
                            </p>
                            <p className='font-semibold'>
                                Collect and analyze data
                                <p className='font-normal'>
                                    Whenever we receive a database from client, we perform data processing to identify any inconsistent records, and check for data anomalies that re present in the database.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                            <p className='font-semibold'>
                                Segmenting data fields
                                <p className='font-normal'>
                                    Later our team of data experts separate inaccurate records from correct records. This process helps to erase all the irrelevant data fields and identify gaps in the database.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                            <p className='font-semibold'>
                                Eliminate duplicate records
                                <p className='font-normal'>
                                    After the successful segmentation of data fields and data profiling, all the duplicate and inconsistent data records are identified and eliminated to resolve redundancy in the database.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                            <p className='font-semibold'>
                                Standardize the cleansing procedure
                                <p className='font-normal'>
                                    Once the data validation is over, the information is standardized to a common format for easy integration into any CRM. This standardized data can be used to run data-driven marketing functions.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                            <p className='font-semibold'>
                                Integrity checks
                                <p className='font-normal'>
                                    Finally the cleansed data undergoes multiple stringent checks to maintain data quality. Further, our data cleansing experts also audit the contact records to ensure that the data is actionable.
                                </p>
                                <p className='font-normal'>
                                    At last, we forward cleansed database to our clients in their required format!
                                </p>
